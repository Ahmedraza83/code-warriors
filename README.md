# Student management system

> **Abstract** : This Student Management System in C helps users keep track of student information by saving it in a file. It allows you to add new students, view all student details, search for a student by roll number, and update their information, like their name or marks. The system uses simple file operations to store and retrieve this data, so it stays saved even after the program is closed.
